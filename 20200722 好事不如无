《好事不如无》
Good-doing is not as good as non-doing

赵州禅师讲：“拜佛是好事，好事不如无。”
Zen Master Zhaozhou said:"Bowing to the Buddha is great. Yet non-doing is better. "
拜佛是好事，好事怎么不如无事呢？
How come? 

天天念经、拜佛、修行，肯定是好事。
For sure, it’s great if you practice buddhism, such as chanting sutras, bowing to Buddha, etc on a daily basis. 
我们拜佛、念经、念佛、用功，都是为了成就功德，而不是为了追求外在的形相：拜佛的形相、念经的形相、用功的形相。
But our practice, worshiping, and chanting sutras or Buddhas’ names are not for the sake of showing off that we are worshiping, chanting, or making an effort.
不是要给别人留下印象：这个人很用功、很精进、很努力。
It’s not our purpose to impress others that we are very diligent. 

大部分的人都很注意自己的形象，总想给别人留下好的印象；
Most people are so concerned about their images, that they always want to make a good impression on others.
要让人家觉得这个人很灵活、很聪明、很努力、很会代人着想、特吃苦耐劳……
They want people to think that they are  very flexible, smart, diligent, considerate, or hard-working, etc.
他注意的只是怎么做才能给人留下好印象，怎么做这种好印象才能持续，只是追求一个相上的成就。
What they care about is how to make a good impression that lasts. They  only pursue  the achievements on the apparent level.

We often say,” Do not chase after the reward.” And this, is the so-called chasing-after-the-reward.
# (果相另几种翻译：retribution, effect, or the mark of effect)
追求果相，就是追求眼前的东西，就不能持续和长久，不可能有大成就，所以说：“念佛是好事，好事不如无。”
Chasing-after-the-reward, is pursuing what lies right in front of us. It will not sustain or last long, and cannot bring us great achievements. 
Therefore, it’s said,” Chanting Buddha is good indeed, yet, a deed inferior to Abhava”.  (Or: Chanting is a good deed, a deed inferior to Abhava.)

不如无”，就是说不能追求形相，我们要追求的是究竟的果报，是长远的，根本的利益-佛果。
“Inferior to Abhava”: that is to say, we shall not focus on the appearance. What we shall pursue is the ultimate outcome, the long-term and fundamental benefit— Buddhahood.
