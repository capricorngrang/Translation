《好事不如无》
Good thing is not as good as nothing

大部分的人都很注意自己的形象，总想给别人留下好的印象；
Most people are very concerned about their image, and they always want to make a good impression on others.
要让人家觉得这个人很灵活、很聪明、很努力、很会代人着想、特吃苦耐劳……
To make people feel that this person is very flexible, very smart, diligent, very considerate, particularly hard-working, et al. 

他注意的只是怎么做才能给人留下好印象，怎么做这种好印象才能持续，只是追求一个相上的成就。
What they care about is how to make a good impression and continue the impact. Their pursuits are merely the achievement of ‘appearance.’




我们常常讲不要追求果相,这个就叫做追求果相。
We often say,” Do not chase after the reward.” And this, is the so-called chasing-after-the-reward.

# (果相另几种翻译：retribution, effect, or the mark of effect)

追求果相，就是追求眼前的东西，就不能持续和长久，不可能有大成就，所以说：“念佛是好事，好事不如无。”
Chasing-after-the-reward, is pursuing what lies right in front of us. It will not sustain or last long, and cannot bring us great achievements. Therefore, it’s said,” Chanting Buddha is good indeed, yet, a deed inferior to Abhava”.  (Or: Chanting is a good deed, a deed inferior to Abhava.)

不如无”，就是说不能追求形相，我们要追求的是究竟的果报，是长远的，根本的利益-佛果。
“Inferior to Abhava”: that is to say, we shall not focus on the appearance. What we shall pursue is the ultimate outcome, the long-term and fundamental benefit— Buddhahood.
